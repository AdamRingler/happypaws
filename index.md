Finding a reliable pet-sitter/walker is hard work. Scheduling & coordinating the logistics can be even more challenging! Rest assure, I’m here to relieve you of your pet-care woes so you can have a stress & worry-free time away from your furry loved ones. Enjoy that vacation to the mountains that you’ve always wanted.

In an over saturated pet-care market, why employ my expert pet-sitting/walking services over the others?

Let me tell you THREE reasons why to use my services over the online services of others.
* I have over 5-years of experience working at the Humane Society (in Kansas). I know all the in’s & out’s of proper animal boarding, lodging, and feeding schedules. I’ve been there at the best & worse of times.
* I possess 15-years of working experience as a veterinarian assistant & technician. You can vacation away peacefully knowing I am trained to recognize medical signs and will alert you and your veterinarian in any emergency.
* I ABSOLUTELY love animals and always been passionate about working and with furry loved-ones. You can sleep peacefully knowing your furry family members will be treated with the same love I devote to my own pets.

Outside those qualities, I have/can watch dogs, cats, and exotic pets such as rabbits, ferrets, birds, horses and more! No breed is too strange nor too exotic; chances are, I’ve worked and cared for it.

**If that’s not enough, how about this?**
* Do you care about our local economy?
* Do you try to Buy Green and Shop Local?

Every dollar you spend with me, directly recirculates through our Louisville, Colorado economy.

Your “pet-sitting” dollars go immediately back into our morning farmer’s market, where we purchase our food to nourish our two growing children. It recirculates to support the local recreation center, book stores, and dining establishments. A dollar spent with me (versus Rover or other Silicon Valley applications) is a dollar supporting your local economy. That’s win-win! Unfortunately, due to my family’s schedule (full-time Mom of two wonderful children), I typically do not perform any over night pet-sitting services.

I ALWAYS perform an end-of-evening pet-check at the home to make sure your fur-balls are tucked in bed and snugged up tight. If you have any questions or are interested in my Dog Walking or Pet-Sitting, don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly through this direct message OR call me and we can discuss more.

I look forward to hearing from you!
